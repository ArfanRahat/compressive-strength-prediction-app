This project, "Concrete Compressive Strength Predictor," is a machine learning web application that forecasts concrete strength based on mix design. Built with Streamlit for the frontend, LightGBM for predictions, and Plotly for visualization, it offers an interactive interface, real-time results with gauge charts, and pre-loaded examples. The LightGBM Regressor model, trained on 11 concrete mix parameters including cement, aggregates, water, and curing days, delivers high accuracy and robust predictions. You can easily set it up locally by cloning the GitHub repository, installing dependencies from requirements.txt, adding the lightgbm\_regressor\_model.pkl file, and running streamlit run app.py.
