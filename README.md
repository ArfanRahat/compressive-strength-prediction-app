# compressive-strength-prediction-app
This project, "Concrete Compressive Strength Predictor," is a machine learning web application that forecasts concrete strength based on mix design. Built with Streamlit for the frontend, LightGBM for predictions, and Plotly for visualization, it offers an interactive interface, real-time results with gauge charts, and pre-loaded examples.
